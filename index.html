        <h2>OUR ITINERARY</h2>
        <p>
          Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
          Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
          live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics

          <h4>Mt. Yoshino</h4>
          <p>
            Mount Yoshino in Nara Prefecture is one of Japan’s most famous
            cherry blossom viewing spots. There are over 30.000 cherry trees to
            admire around the roads that lead up the mountain and it covers all
            of the paths. If you want to get the best views of the blossoms, be
            sure to check out either Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine or Hanayagura
            Observatory. Next to the beautiful nature, there is also a lot of
            culture to enjoy. At mount Yoshino you you can also find lots of
            gorgeous shrines and temples. Furthermore, there are a lot of
            traditional ryokans where you can relax in an outdoor hot spring.

        <h4>Nara Park</h4>
        <p>
          Located about an hour or so south of Osaka, Nara Park is most famous
          for its adorable and mischievous deer. In addition to these free
          roaming wild critters, Nara park also has two very important cultural
          assets, the Giant Buddha at Todai-ji temple and the Kasuga Grand
          Shrine. If you plan on visiting Nara, be sure to get an early start as
          many of the attractions close by 5pm. Be sure to get there before
          lunch so that you have sufficient time for meandering amongst the deer
          and being completely awed by the park!

      <h4>Kiso Valley</h4>
      <p>
        The Kiso Valley is located well off the beaten path but at the same time WAS ironically on the beaten path. One of two major highways from Tokyo to Kyoto, the Nakasendo, once zigzagged through these mountains transporting countless traders for hundreds of years. Today, much of the old road is preserved and provides a great hiking adventure. Furthermore, the outpost towns of Magome and Tsumago have gone to great lengths to authentically recreate an environment allowing one to envision and experience life during medieval times. Cool, right?!

      <h4>Gioji Moss Gardens</h4>
      <p>
        Located in the highly visited Arashiyama neighbourhood of Kyoto, Gio-ji Temple and Moss Gardens can be considered a hidden gem. But why do travellers so easily overlook it? From the famous Bamboo Groves, Gio-ji is about 3.2 kilometres away making it quite the journey by foot if you don’t have a bicycle! If you decide to make the journey through the lovely backstreets of Arashiyama as I did to get there, you’re sure to be rewarded as these gardens are truly a breathtaking sight. Moss coloured in different emerald shades almost completely covers all ground surfaces under canopies of shady trees, while a small number of stone footpaths help to immerse you in the tranquil setting. Depending on the season, you may also get to see lovely little purple flowers scattered throughout the mossy carpet.
As the small temple and gardens are in more of an isolated location in Kyoto, the bonus is you may be lucky enough to have these peaceful gardens all to yourself during your visit!
