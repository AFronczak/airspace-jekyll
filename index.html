        <h2>JAPAN IN SPRING</h2>
        <p>
          In spring the air is thick with the sweet scent of cherry blossoms that pervade every corner of Kyoto, Japan’s ancient capital. The ocean of pink blooms covering the slopes of the Eastern Hills lightly sway in the cool breeze enthralling passers-by with their transient beauty, and inviting them to follow the trail of the blossoms through countless weather-beaten temple gates and the beautiful gardens of royal villas hidden behind tall walls.
